            <em>
                The city of Oshawa, Ontario has vanished without a trace. Even worse, nobody remembers 
                it or the 170,000 missing residents that disappeared along with it. As the survivors also 
                fall into the forgotten, they must seek each other out, if they hope to have any chance of 
                surviving in a world where no one believes they exist... RECOMMENDED!!

            <em>
                Robin is a big city reporter, embedded with US Marines heading to the hostile pocket 
                universe called Terminus. Ten minutes in, the entire marine squad is wiped out and she has 
                to survive (and report) on her own. Terminus is full of cosmic wonders-and sci-fi "gods" 
                that are in the middle of a political power struggle. The language is alien, and the 
                politics are deadly. Can she survive long enough to figure out what's going on and get home 
                to tell the story? RECOMMENDED!!

            <em>
                In this vibrant, tongue-in-cheek adventure series, atypical teen Avani and midwestern 
                jock Trent teleport across a post-Cold War landscape to collect bizarre relics. Why? Well, 
                because they need to summon the arcane powers of a resplendent 17th-century cabinet to fix 
                a teeny-tiny mistake the last time Avani used it... unleashing an ancient evil from its 
                prison and accidentally slaughtering her parents.

                The mysterious "U" has no memory of his past before awakening with powers after the 
                Great Death that took many lives and created the superpowered Reborns. In searching for a 
                purpose, a reason to live, he discovers Isabelle, whose father died in the plague, and who 
                has recently been thrown out to live in the streets by her uncle. When the two meet, a 
                spark is lit between them. But another spark is lit-one that's sure to lead to explosive 
                consequences-when U runs afoul of a crime syndicate that will stop at nothing to get 
                revenge.

                the worst possible time: a new threat heralded by the Wizard - with a horrifying eldritch 
                upgrade - is coming for their heads, and if they can't find a way to repair their damaged 
                bond, it will cost them their lives.
